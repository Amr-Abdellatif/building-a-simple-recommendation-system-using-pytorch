# In this project im trying to work myway around recommendation systems specifically using collaborative filtering

## I use simple 100k movie ratings dataset .. in which i attached in the repo for purposes of replicating the same resuls 

# of course this can be upgraded to included other meta data and increase complexity

* Collaborative filtering is based on the fact that relationships exist between products and peopleâ€™s interests. Many recommendation systems use collaborative filtering to find these relationships and to give an accurate recommendation of a product that the user might like or be interested in

* Collaborative filtering has basically two approaches: user-based and item-based. User-based collaborative filtering is based on the user similarity or neighborhood.
